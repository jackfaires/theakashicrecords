                way. He was 17 when he realized he wanted to be purposeful in his creative ability. 2014 was the year his

                change. Cornelius is currently pursuing his undergraduate studies in Mass Communication and Broadcast
                Journalism at The Southern University and A&M College located in Baton Rouge, La. Aside from his creative
                collaborations with other independent artist, he has also been recognized by names such as the Baton Rouge
                Poetry Alliance and Red Stick Radio. Inspired by the many intricacies of life, Cornelius has big plans to
